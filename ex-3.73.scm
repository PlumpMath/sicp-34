;;; We can model electrical circuits using streams to represent the values of
;;; currents or voltages at a sequence of times. For instance, suppose we have
;;; an RC circuit consisting of a resistor of resistance R and a capacitor of
;;; capacitance C in series. The voltage response v of the circuit to an
;;; injected current i is determined by the formula in figure 3.33, whose
;;; structure is shown by the accompanying signal-flow diagram.
;;;
;;; Write a procedure RC that models this circuit. RC should take as inputs the
;;; values of R, C, and dt and should return a procedure that takes as inputs
;;; a stream representing the current i and an initial value for the capacitor
;;; voltage v0 and produces as output the stream of voltages v. For example,
;;; you should be able to use RC to model an RC circuit with R = 5 ohms,
;;; C = 1 farad, and a 0.5-second time step by evaluating (define RC1 (RC
;;; 5 1 0.5)). This defines RC1 as a procedure that takes a stream representing
;;; the time sequence of currents and an initial capacitor voltage and produces
;;; the output stream of voltages.
